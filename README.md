Console application with machine learning in Java

The application guesses the animal guessed by a human. The human must guess the animal and then answer leading questions. If the program fails to guess the animal, it asks the human to enter what kind of animal it is and a fact that distinguishes it from other animals.

Machine learning is based on a binary tree data structure.

The project allowed me to hone my skills in graphs (BFS, DFS), working with binary trees, and design patterns (singleton).

Data after closing the application is saved to disk as a json file. Also the program can recognize different user response options (yes = y/yeap/....). Response options can be customized via txt files in src/main/resources directory.

It is possible to view statistics: tree data, visualize tree structure, print a list of animals, and search for a path to a single animal
