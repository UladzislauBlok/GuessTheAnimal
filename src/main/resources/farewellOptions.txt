Farewell
Bye
Goodbye
See you later
See you soon
See you tomorrow
Take care
Have a good one
Catch you later
Later
All the best
Peace out
Adieu
So long
Until next time
Cheers
Adios
Bon voyage
Godspeed
Have a safe trip
Goodnight
Sleep tight
Sweet dreams
I gotta run
I gotta go
Gotta dash
It’s been a pleasure
Take it easy
Keep in touch
Bye for now
Good luck
Bye-bye
Have a nice day
Enjoy the rest of your day
Have a great weekend
Until we meet again
See you in a bit
TTFN (Ta-ta for now)
Catch you on the flip side
Smell you later
See you around
Be well
Stay safe
Be good
Be seeing you
Cheerio
Come again
Don’t forget to write
Don’t get lost
Don’t keep me waiting
Don’t work too hard
Fare thee well
Get outta here
Give my regards to Broadway
God be with you
Gotta hit the road
Have a good trip
Have a safe journey
Have a wonderful day
Have fun storming the castle
Here’s looking at you, kid
Hope to see you soon
I gotta jet
I’ll be back
I’ll catch you on the flip side
I’m out
Keep the faith
Keep up the good work
Later gator
Let’s do lunch
Live long and prosper
May the Force be with you
My time is up
No worries
Over and out
Peace and love
Peace be with you
See you in a jiffy
So fare thee well
Take a hike
Take care of yourself
Take it sleazy
Take the long way home
That’s all folks
To infinity and beyond
Toodles
Until we speak again
Warm regards
What’s up, buttercup?
You’re outta here!
As you wish
Be safe out there
Catch you on the rebound
Check you later
Enjoy the journey
Every goodbye is a new beginning
Good travels
Gotta bounce
Hang loose
Have a blast
Have a good one, mate
Have a killer day
Have a safe flight
Have a safe trip home
Have a smashing time
Have a splendid evening
Have a splendid day
Have a sweet day
Have an awesome day
Have fun
Hope to hear from you soon
I need to get going
